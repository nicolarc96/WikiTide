For example: 2024-11-19T19:00:00Z If no value is specified, no stop time is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | string |           |

| ⌛ Schedule Lookback/Window     |                | `lookback`    | To ensure that all relevant data is searched, configure the lookback to be at least as long as the search frequency. Overlapping searches help to ensure that all relevant data is included, regardless of when logs are uploaded. However, with overlapping searches, a given event or indicator might appear in more than one resulting incident. | string |           |
